**Mini Game Mode:** Play all three mini games (brick breaker, simon, and snake) in any order you want and as many times as you want.

**Story Mode:** Help Princess Peach save Mario from the clutches of Bowser by aiding her through castles which hold a mini game. In order to defeat the castle, you must win the mini game.
